- Role-based command access (`Admin` vs `Customer`)
- Efficient search using `unordered_map`
- Function pointer-based command dispatch system
- Book key generation to avoid duplicates

## Technologies

- C++17
- Standard Library (`<vector>`, `<unordered_map>`, `<map>`, `<fstream>`, etc.)
- No external libraries, no smart pointers

## How to Use

- **Build**: Ensure you have `g++` installed (supporting C++17). Then compile using ``make`` from the project folder.
- **Run**: To run use ``./app``. You will be prompted to pick a role. Use ``help`` to view all commands.
